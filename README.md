IMDB Movies Analysis
This project focuses on examining a dataset of the top 100 movies on IMDb from the past decade, where IMDb is a well-known platform for movie ratings and reviews. The dataset contains a variety of information about these movies
Here are some key tips before starting the assignment:

Understand the Data: Review the data dictionary carefully to know what each column represents. This helps in accurate analysis.

Follow Instructions: Read each instruction thoroughly. Focus on the specific task required before writing any code to avoid unnecessary work.

Use Provided Names: If variable names are given or suggested, use them exactly as mentioned.

Check Your Work: After performing operations on your data, inspect the results to ensure everything is correct.

Learn and Research: If you encounter functions you havenâ€™t used before, do a quick online search to learn about them. This assignment is also a learning process.

Run Code Sequentially: To avoid errors, run the notebook cells in order. You can add extra cells if needed.

Make Charts Readable: For plot-related tasks, ensure charts are the right size for easy reading. Use subplots for comparing charts side by side.

Write Clear Inferences: When writing inferences from plots, provide thoughtful observations. These answers are subjective but important.

Use Checkpoints: Refer to checkpoints in the notebook to confirm if your results are correct.

Practice with Optional Tasks: Optional subtasks aren't graded but are good for practice. Complete them after finishing the main assignment.
